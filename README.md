# 🏦 Bank Loan Approval Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a bank loan should be approved based on applicant details. It helps banks automate and speed up the loan approval process while reducing manual errors.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Used**: Loan Prediction Dataset (from Kaggle or similar)
